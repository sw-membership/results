2,0.9999986886978149,Co Ltd likely saw a 38% surge in profit for the April-June quarter thanks to strong chip prices and demand spurred by a pandemic-led consumer appetite for electronics as well as recovering investment in data centres.
2,0.9999986886978149,Operating profit for the world's biggest memory chip and smartphone maker likely jumped to 11.3 trillion won ($10 billion), according to a Refinitiv SmartEstimate drawn from 20 analysts and weighted toward those who are more consistently accurate.
0,0.9999629259109497,The South Korean tech giant's strong performance - coming despite it shipping fewer smartphones than in January-March - underscores the stratospheric demand for chips that has depleted stockpiles and filled production capacity.
2,0.9999985694885254,The result would be up 20% from the first quarter and mark Samsung (KS:005930)'s highest operating income for the second quarter since 2018.
2,0.9999985694885254,Revenue likely rose 15.4%.
1,0.9999974966049194,Samsung is scheduled to announce preliminary second-quarter results on Wednesday.
2,0.9999983310699463,The company's chip division likely benefited from memory chip price hikes that exceeded market estimates, analysts said, while shipments grew as well.
2,0.9999986886978149,Prices of DRAM chips, widely used in servers, mobile phones and other computing devices, jumped 27% compared to the March quarter, while those of NAND flash chips that serve the data storage market rose 8.6%, according to research provider Trendforce.
2,0.9999986886978149,Profit also improved at Samsung's chip-contract manufacturing and logic chip design business, partly because operations at its storm-hit Texas factory returned to normal, analysts said.
2,0.9999986886978149,They estimated the chip division's operating profit in April-June rose about 22% from the year-earlier period to about 6.6 trillion won.
0,0.9999991655349731,Still, Samsung's smartphone shipments dropped to about 59 million in April-June from about 76 million in the first quarter, according to Shinyoung Investment & Securities, as sales slowed for its latest flagship model, launched in mid-January.
0,0.9999992847442627,Reduced demand from India, hard hit by the pandemic during the quarter, as well as tight supply for some mobile processor chips may also have affected shipments, analysts said, estimating the mobile business' operating profit at about 2.9 trillion won.
1,0.9999945163726807,Samsung Electronics vice chairman to leave prison on Friday * Lee still faces two other trials * Decision on company's $17 billion U.S. investment awaits (Adds bullet points, global chip shortage, rivals, Samsung no comment)
1,0.9974828362464905,By Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang SEOUL, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics vice chairman Jay Y. Lee, in jail after convictions for bribery, embezzlement and other charges, has qualified for parole and is expected to leave prison this Friday, South Korea's justice ministry said.
1,0.9999983310699463,"The decision to grant Samsung Electronics vice chairman Jay Y. Lee parole was the result of a comprehensive review of various factors such as public sentiment and good behavior during detention," the ministry said in a statement on Monday.
1,0.9999978542327881,Convicted of bribing a friend of former President Park Geun-hye, Lee, 53, has served 18 months of a revised 30 month sentence.
1,0.9999990463256836,He initially served one year of a five-year sentence from August 2017 which was later suspended.
1,0.999998927116394,That court decision was then overturned and while the sentence was shortened, he was sent back to jail in January this year.
0,0.7302665114402771,Support for his parole, both political and public and from the wider business community, had grown amid anxiety that key strategic decisions are not being made at the South Korean tech giant.
1,0.9999988079071045,Although the day-to-day running of the world's biggest memory chip maker and smartphone manufacturer has not been affected by his absence, company sources say decisions on major investment and M&A projects should only be made by Lee.
2,0.6750251054763794,In particular, a decision on the location of a $17 billion U.S. plant to produce advanced logic chips awaits his return at a time when there is a global chip shortage and rivals like TSMC and Intel Corp are making large investments.
2,0.9999980926513672,The Federation of Korean Industries, a big business lobby, said in a statement that it welcomed the decision to grant Lee parole.
1,0.9585440158843994,"If the investment clock, currently at standstill, is not wound up quickly, we could lag behind global companies such as Intel and TSMC and lose the Korean economy's bread and butter at a moment's notice.
1,0.9999984502792358," Lee still needs the Justice Minister to approve his return to work as the law bars persons with certain convictions from working for companies related to those convictions for five years.
1,0.9999988079071045,He is likely to get that, legal experts say, due to circumstances such as the amount deemed embezzled having been repaid.
1,0.9999991655349731,Samsung Electronics declined to comment.
1,0.9999983310699463,HIGH SUPPORT South Korea's biggest conglomerates are still owned and controlled by their founding families and there is little precedence for handing over the reins to outsiders even when a senior family member has been jailed.
0,0.9996849298477173,While polls showed high public support of around 70% for Lee's parole, many civic groups have been opposed, accusing the administration of President Moon Jae-In of hypocrisy after it came to power on a wave of anger at corruption among South Korea's political and business elite.
2,0.9999266862869263,"If the administration that benefited grants preferential parole for a chaebol owner, we must reconsider the very existence of the Moon Jae-in administration," said Kim Ju-ho, official at activist group People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, using the local term for large family-owned businesses.
1,0.9999991655349731,Lee's legal woes have not been confined to the bribery conviction.
1,0.9999983310699463,He is also on trial accused of accounting fraud and stock price manipulation connected to a 2015 merger of two Samsung companies.
1,0.9999983310699463,A South Korean court also decided in June that he should be tried in separate case in which he has been accused of unlawfully using a sedative.
1,0.9997773766517639,Lee has denied the accusations in both cases.

2,0.9999948740005493,Electronics is banking on Europe to maintain growth momentum in its network equipment business, a senior executive said, as 5G rollout widens and industry leader Huawei Technologies of China focuses on its domestic market.
1,0.9999986886978149,Although the South Korean tech company is global No. 1 in memory chips and smartphones, in 5G network equipment it ranks fifth behind Huawei, Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and ZTE (HK:0763) based on the latest four quarters, with a 10-15% market share in the first quarter of 2021, according to market research firm Dell'Oro Group.
2,0.9999985694885254,But as Samsung (KS:005930) landed a $6.6 billion deal with U.S. telecoms company Verizon (NYSE:VZ) in September, followed by a deal with Japan's NTT Docomo (OTC:DCMYY) in March, "impressions have changed", Woojune Kim, executive vice president of Samsung's networks business, told Reuters in an interview on Friday.
1,0.999997615814209,Samsung is currently conducting 5G trials with European telecom companies such as Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) in the Czech Republic, Play Communications in Poland and another major European firm, Kim said.
2,0.9999723434448242,Besides Europe, Samsung is also looking to expand in markets such as India, Australia and Southeast Asia, he added.
1,0.9998762607574463,The network equipment business is small currently for Samsung, which had revenue of 236.8 trillion won ($212.50 billion) for 2020.
1,0.9999990463256836,It does not announce separate numbers for the business and most analysts don't have estimates for it.
2,0.9999986886978149,Samsung said since the 5G network rollouts began in 2019 in various countries, it has seen the number of new clients for its 5G equipments and systems rise by 35% a year on average.
2,0.9999978542327881,In addition to 5G rollouts, U.S. pressure on its allies to exclude Huawei from 5G systems has provided opportunities for its competitors to expand market share.
1,0.9996217489242554,Samsung is touting its virtualised RAN (radio access network) technology, or software that allows telecom companies to freely use off-the-shelf network equipment in various combinations to connect users to networks, saving costs and providing flexibility.
1,0.9999926090240479,Verizon has adopted this technology for 5G RAN, while in South Korea, all operators' 5G core networks are virtualised, Samsung said, with the country's very heavy use of online services like e-commerce and food delivery compared to population size serving as a benchmark.
1,0.9999943971633911,Samsung's goal is to become top-three in the 5G network equipment business, Kim said.
1,0.9999990463256836,However, Kim did not give a timeframe, citing the industry's long incubation time.
2,0.9999973773956299,"It took us about a decade to win the Verizon deal, since forming early relationships...
2,0.9999980926513672,It takes persistence," he said.
1,0.9999986886978149,SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee, convicted of bribery and embezzlement, has been released on parole.

2,0.46135684847831726,Support for his parole, both political and amongst the public, has grown amid anxiety that key strategic decisions are not being made at the South Korean tech giant.
2,0.8731856346130371,If he is released, Samsung (KS:005930) would be able to move forward with major investment and M&A projects - decisions company sources say should only be made by Lee who has been unable to address them while he sits in jail convicted of bribery and embezzlement.
1,0.9999979734420776,In particular, a decision on the location of a $17 billion U.S. plant to produce advanced logic chips awaits his return, four Samsung sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
1,0.9999983310699463,"The word is that the U.S. investment will be finalised when Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee is back," said one of the people.

1,0.9999986886978149,"Semiconductors need large investment decisions and the decisions can only be made quickly when the head of the conglomerate is present," Moon's office quoted Kim as saying.
1,0.9999990463256836,Lee served one year of an initial 5-year sentence from August 2017 which was later suspended.
1,0.9999983310699463,That court decision was overturned and the sentence revised to 30 months https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-heir-idUSKBN29M0PQ, putting him back in jail in January this year.
1,0.999998927116394,Having served some 18 months, he has just become eligible for release.
2,0.9999984502792358,The Justice Ministry last month eased parole eligibility guidelines for first-time offenders with good behaviour like Lee to 60% of sentence term served.
0,0.8830176591873169,The average eligible time for all criminals in South Korea was 80% prior to the easing.
1,0.9999982118606567,Lee's parole is expected to be reviewed on Aug. 9, and within Samsung hopes are high that he will be freed around Aug. 15 when the country celebrates Independence Day and pardons have traditionally been issued, three of the Samsung sources said.
1,0.9999991655349731,The Justice Ministry and Samsung declined to comment.
1,0.9999983310699463,If paroled, Lee would need the Justice Minister to approve his return to work as the law bars persons from working for companies involved in certain convictions for five years.

2,0.9978458881378174,While there have been some protests against an early release for Lee and civic groups have voiced opposition, public support for his early release is at about 70%, according to two polls.
1,0.9999977350234985,A parliamentary committee leader has also voiced his support while other members of the ruling party have visited Samsung's chip complex noting that Lee is eligible for parole.
1,0.9999970197677612,Support on social media ranges from those who think he has already paid his dues while others fret that without Lee at the helm, South Korea's flagship conglomerate will fall behind competitors at a time when there is a global chip shortage and rivals like TSMC and Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) are making large investments https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tsmc-investment-plan-idUSKBN2BO3ZJ.
1,0.9999988079071045,CASH PILE AWAITS USE South Korea's biggest conglomerates are still owned and controlled by their founding families and there is little precedence for handing over the reins to non-family members even when a senior family member has been jailed.
1,0.9999983310699463,On one hand, Samsung's day-to-day operations have been little affected by Lee's stints in prison.
2,0.9999985694885254,Operating profit in the latest quarter surged 54% and while he was jailed in 2017, Samsung reported its second-largest annual profit of 53.6 trillion won ($46.6 billion).
1,0.9999966621398926,But experts say Samsung's organisational structure makes it difficult for anyone besides Lee to sign off on strategic decisions that draw on cash pooled from its three main divisions - mobile, consumer electronics and chips. "
1,0.9999934434890747,Realistically, risky strategic decisions like M&A, multibillion dollar deals, are left to the owner at Samsung," said Jaeyong Song, professor at Seoul National University and author of "The Samsung Way", a book about Samsung's management style.
1,0.9999969005584717,"CEOs in Korea are more like chief operating officers in a way.
1,0.9999901056289673,They take care of the short-term profits, while the owner takes on long-term competitiveness because their tenure is for life.
1,0.9999983310699463,"
0,0.9999892711639404,Analysts have also linked Lee's legal troubles to Samsung's huge pile of cash, which has swollen 57% over four years to stand at just under $100 billion as of end-June, noting it has not made a major acquisition since 2016.
0,0.9999752044677734,Chief Financial Officer Choi Yoon-ho told an earnings briefing in January the increase was mainly due to Samsung's inability to "execute meaningful M&A activities".
2,0.9999984502792358,In addition to the decision on the planned U.S. chip factory - which has come down to Austin, Texas which is widely seen as the favoured location, another area in Texas, New York or Arizona - Lee's return would likely trigger potential acquisitions of stakes in companies, analysts said.
2,0.9997803568840027,NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI), a Dutch maker of automotive chips with a market value of about $58 billion, has often been cited by analysts as a good fit for Samsung's strategic needs and a likely target.
1,0.9999990463256836,NXP declined to comment.
1,0.9999979734420776,Samsung SDI is considering an investment of at least $3.5 billion in the United States to produce batteries for electric vehicles, but a final decision will rest with a task force for the wider Samsung group and is unlikely to be made before the chip plant decision, one of the sources said.

1,0.9999991655349731,DRAM and NAND charts presented in this article show significant financial differences.
1,0.999998927116394,For investors, this raises the question of whether memory companies should be gauged as competitors or allies.
1,0.9999990463256836,This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing community, Semiconductor Deep Dive.
2,0.9999977350234985,Get started today » Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) on July 7, 2020, announced its preliminary earnings guidance for the second quarter, reporting operating profit of 8.1 trillion won and beating consensus of 6.5 trillion won.
2,0.9999986886978149,The company forecast it would post an operating profit for Q2, up 22.7% YoY and 25.6% QoQ.
2,0.9999955892562866,The upbeat earnings guidance was announced before the U.S. market opened on July 7.
0,0.9999994039535522,Nevertheless, Micron Technology’s (MU) stock opened at $50.53 and dropped throughout the day, closing down 3.6%.
0,0.9999969005584717,Evidently, the market wasn’t impressed by Samsung’s upbeat preannouncement, because Samsung itself was down 3.8%, as was fellow Korean memory company SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCL), which was down 2.9%.
0,0.9999995231628418,Incidentally, the Korean stock market Kospi was down 1.5%, as was Nasdaq, down 1.0%.
1,0.9999988079071045,Market sentiment has collectively grouped the three companies together.
0,0.9999983310699463,In other words, good news/bad news coming from Samsung or SK Hynix or Micron has resulted in comparable stock reaction among all three companies, as indicated by the activity on July 7.

2,0.9999977350234985,Importantly, Micron continues to make progress on its 1a node, which I expect to introduce in fiscal 2021.
2,0.9999986886978149,Micron’s DRAM bit shipments expanded significantly QoQ, driven by rapid work-from-home infrastructure deployment, as well as increased 5G deployment, particularly in Asia.
