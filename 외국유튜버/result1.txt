1,0.999998927116394,and they have 6.8 billion shares outstanding let's look at the financials the way you value a company
1,0.9999982118606567,is you estimate the free cash flows into the future
2,0.8917694687843323,and then you discount those numbers back to today's value that's what we're doing in this video and free cash flow is cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures so you can see this company has a lot of free cash flow each year peaking in 2018 at 36 trillion net income is the profit and loss on the income statement its revenue minus expenses that also peaked in 2018 at 44 trillion it's currently 26 trillion revenue is a sales for the company and that's pretty steady from 240 trillion to 237 trillion this is the company's income statement the top line is the revenue the sales below that is the cost of revenue these are the expenses directly related to generating the revenue and the difference is the gross profit and they had the highest gross profit in 2018 that was a year they had their highest revenue then below that is operating expenses examples are marketing and depreciation then below that is operating income which is also the highest in 2018.
2,0.9999974966049194,they pay 583 billion of interest on their debt that's the lowest interest they paid in the past four years and the bottom line of the income statement is their net income which is 26 trillion higher than 2019 but lower than 2017 and 18.
1,0.9999885559082031,this is the company's statement of cash flows the top line is operating cash flow that's how much cash the company generates from its operational business you could think of operating cash flow as net income converted to cash because net income is your accounting profit and loss it's not actual cash you can see in 2020 they generated almost the same amount of cash flow as in 2018 with much lower revenue in 2020.
1,0.9999896287918091,then you have capital expenditures which are investments in property plant and equipment operating cash flow minus capex gives you your free cash flow they do have a lot of free cash flow each year but most of that free cash flow goes towards their dividend payment it looks like the company bought back a lot of stock in 2017 they also bought back some stock in 2018.
1,0.9999842643737793,when a company buys back stock it decreases the shares outstanding making your shares more valuable they paid down a lot of debt in 2017 18 and 19.
1,0.999998927116394,they added some debt in 2020.
1,0.9999709129333496,let's look at the capital structure they're 93 equity 7 debt and their net debt is negative so they could pay down all the debt with the cash on a balance sheet and still have a lot of cash remaining their whack is 9.2 percent and that's a discount rate we're going to apply to the future cash flows we estimated four years of future free cash flows we also estimated a terminal value which is all cash flows past year four that's 470 trillion we discounted those numbers back to today using the weighted average cost of capital and we get a value of the company of 428 trillion ones we divide that by 6.8 billion shares and we get a calculated stock price of 63 000 they're trading at 81 500
1,0.9999887943267822,so they're trading at a 29 premium it's a sell according to the model simply wall street's valuation is 87 600
1,0.9999986886978149,so they're saying the stock is undervalued this is a stock price the last five years
1,0.9999769926071167,so it looks like it's only gone up it hit its peak a few months ago
1,0.9999922513961792,but it's still trading at a pretty high level they pay a 3.68 dividend yield they pay out 78 of their net income 81 of their free cash flow so most of their money goes towards their dividend payment their beta is 0.93
2,0.9999779462814331,so the stock moves with the market the stock has gone up 63 in the past 52 weeks while the s p 500 went up 49 the 52-week high was 96-800 the low was 47 200.
2,0.9999970197677612,the stock is trading above its 200-day but below its 50-day moving average about 17 to 19 million shares are traded each day on this stock of the 6.8 million shares outstanding 5.5 million are on float and 43 percent held by institutions analysts are forecasting their earnings to grow 15 percent their industry also 15 and the market 28 analysts are forecasting their revenue to grow 5.6 their industry 9 and the market 10 in the past five years their annual earnings were flat their industry is up two percent the market is up three percent in the past year their earnings grew 37 percent the industry eight percent and the market nine percent in the past year three years and five years this stock has moved with the industry but has outperformed the market in each of these categories especially in the past three years and five years it crushed the market the biggest shareholder is national pension at 9.1 percent then samsung blackrock another division of samsung and gregory lee let's look at their financial ratios pe is stock price over earnings per share to calculate earnings per share that's net income over shares outstanding they're at 21.2 their price of sales ratio is 2.3 their price to book is 2.1 their return on invested capital is 16 interest coverage ratio of 62 roe of 10 and current ratio of 2.6 most of their current assets are in cash and the company does seem to be well capitalized they had a lot of free cash flow they have a lot of working capital and they also pay a pretty decent size dividend payment but they have over 127 trillion of funding the best way to look at ratios to compare them to companies in the same industry i've done videos on apple and costs both in the same industry as samsung and samsung is better than all the price multiples they have a good current ratio apple is killing in an roe samsung is at 10 cost is negative samsung has the lowest amount of debt they're a big company but of course small and apple and they pay the highest dividend so to summarize i have them trading at a 29 premium this is a monster of a company that's the pride of south korea everybody knows their products they're sold all over the world
