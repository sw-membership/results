2,0.9992497563362122,hello welcome to rational investing my name is cameron stewart cfa thank you very much for tuning in and watching the channel i greatly appreciate it this week up samsung electronics the 400 billion consumer electronic giant that trades at the korean stock exchange we're gonna translate their nine years of historical financial information into dollars we're going to forecast the business and figure out what we can earn by buying the stock today let's get to work all right let's dive into samsung electronics before we do that let's cover the five key attributes that we use to value all the stocks here in this this channel and that would be top line revenue growth we want to see stock that's growing the top line earnings growth we use ebitda we need ebitda growing we want strong free cash flow we want low debt that's less than three times debt to ebitda and we want a well-priced stock well priced we use enterprise value to ebitda as a well-priced metric now behind me is the 10k for samsung in my hand i've printed it and read it
1,0.9999909400939941,and it's a great read i highly recommend you go through it the way they break down the business is very simple it's easy to read
1,0.9999984502792358,and they even translate the material into usd right in the 10k for you now this stock is traded on the korean stock exchange it's not available trading in the u.s you can buy the london stock exchange or the luxembourg stock exchange if you don't want to set up a count in korea to buy the stock but let's take a look and read through this and figure out what we think the stock is worth in our financial model now before we do that like we always do i want to go through the 10k and pull out a couple things for you because i thought they were fascinating also this is in korean one
1,0.9999990463256836,so we have to deal with a little bit of korean to dollar exchange
1,0.9999510049819946,but i'm going to go through that pretty quickly i think you're going to find this fascinating first up the balance sheet right behind me is the balance sheet from the 10k file as of december 31st 2020.
1,0.9999645948410034,this section here is in korean one this is 2020 year in december korean one 2019 then they convert it into usd for you the korean one as it states up here is millions of korean won so this is 29 trillion won the usd numbers are in thousands so this is 24 25 billion dollars
1,0.9999947547912598,okay let's i'll stick in dollars to make it simple from for going forward but cash and cash equivalents one of my favorite line items 25 billion dollars in cash they have on their balance sheet if i drop down a line below that short term financial instruments that is just like cash those are short-term bonds there could be treasuries other government securities but highly liquid assets 78 billion dollars and then right below that short term
1,0.9999934434890747,yeah short term finance short-term financial assets at amortization cost another highly liquid asset 2.3 this here is over 100 billion dollars in cash that they have on their balance sheet that they've generated through operating activity over time which is amazing amazing to see we do not see companies with this much cash on the balance sheet aside from the behemoths the the googles the facebooks the apples the berkshire hathaways those guys have this kind of cash and so does samsung electronics kudos to them that is quite the war chest if we scroll down through the balance sheet to see how this stacks up total current assets 167 billion dollars and if i scroll down all the way through to get to total liabilities total liabilities only eighty six thousand dollars
1,0.9999974966049194,so ben graham's gonna like this company because total current assets in fact all cash can cover all liabilities and still have money to spare that's a huge balance check mark for us that they're running a clean balance sheet they have the cash that they store from from operations if you keep going down you get the p l which itself is really simplified and clean but it does show consistent profit before income tax every single year which is really nice to see i'm going to keep skipping through and go to the cash flow statement now the cash flow statement is actually in or these all all these financials are in korean get korean accounting standards which is slightly different than gaap u.s accounting but the topics are roughly the same you can still pull cash flow from operating activities it varies slightly in that they've got dividend interest in here typically that's excluded from the u.s gap operating that's a financing activity
2,0.9999977350234985,but it's it's fine enough
1,0.999996542930603,and it's positive and large which is what we want to see you can also pull out from investing activity you can pull out property plant equipment for your capex that's a 32 billion dollar annual capex investment that's a big big number
1,0.9999991655349731,and then you've got the financing activity down below which is almost nothing because they have very little debt
1,0.9999312162399292,okay that is the balance sheet let's do a couple other things that i read that i was really surprised at and then we'll get to the long-term financial outlook of the forecast
1,0.9999988079071045,but i'll i'll go through very quickly
1,0.9999984502792358,but i thought it was really interesting to see let's check this out okay now behind me is a breakdown it's way in the back of the 10k i'm on page 87 of their 10k
1,0.999997615814209,but it basically breaks down the entire p l by division they're so big that even a division here is a monster monster company and we want to figure out where do they drive most of the revenue and most of their earnings
1,0.9999988079071045,and i know this is an eye chart i'm sorry it's the biggest i can get to because it's it's spread horizontally
2,0.9975760579109192,but basically you've got the consumer electronics division these are in korean one that's 110 trillion korean won of total revenue imaging 200 trillion wants so double the consumer electronics business
0,0.9999954700469971,and then semiconductors total 200 trillion one they've got a sound division harm in their speaker division which is tiny compared to everything else
1,0.9999942779541016,but the big takeaway for me is if total revenue is 540 trillion won a little other 50 percent of that is the semiconductor industry which i did not know i would have thought them as the electronics the consumer electronics the durable goods like washing machines and so forth imaging not semiconductors specifically but the semiconductor is a monster monster piece of their business and that drives a lot of their revenue and even their operating profit at 18 trillion won is about half the 35 trillion so in line with with with revenue they're mainly that
1,0.999998927116394,and then you've got the the imaging technology
1,0.9999986886978149,the im business is the next runner-up so these two are really the lion's share of the business
1,0.9999971389770508,uh okay let's go one more thing i found out that they have kind of a private equity portfolio inside the business let's go check that out i think this will be really interesting the last piece i want to go to before we do the financials is just look at their private equity portfolio so they've been making investments in technology companies in uh in and around their industry for many many years
1,0.9999920129776001,and i was really surprised to see one particular byd the electric car company they own a tremendous amount of shares they own one one trillion dollars in korean one of that business in total this portfolio would consist of a number of holdings byd being a large large piece of it in total is 7.3 trillion which uh won and in usd is about six billion dollars of a portfolio of equity investments that they have made in a lot of very interesting industries definitely check it out this one happened to be a really hot one
1,0.9999948740005493,and i caught it caught my eye
1,0.999995231628418,but i like companies that take their cash and make equity investments in businesses that they have either a vested interest in this sector like byd right they're selling semiconductors into the electric car market it makes sense for them to bet on one that's growing like that
1,0.9999978542327881,and i like that okay without further ado let's go through and look at the financials now what i've done here is i've pulled the korean wand financials for for for the business and i've converted them into usd using the average for the year exchange rate for the income statement and p l items and the december average for the balance sheet items that's how you convert currency across p l's so let's take a look at revenue samsung electronics again kse is the ticker you can find in the london stock exchange the luxembourg or gorek go directly to uh the korean stock exchange you can't buy in the states unfortunately all these numbers are in millions of usd fiscal year and
2,0.9999570846557617,december 31st check the revenue out 2012 178 billion dollars all the way up to 200 billion dollars in 2020 that's a one percent growth rate nothing to write home about technically checks our box in that it is this positive number
1,0.9999966621398926,but it's not keeping up with inflation and it's really really a lackluster
2,0.9999984502792358,i would think for such a dynamic company i kind of expected a bit more but let's let's keep going ebitda ebay does our earnings for the company that's what we want to see that we want to see grow and uh it does grow 4.3 over time 39 billion dollars usd on a 178 billion dollars of revenue that grows to 55 billion dollars on 200 over time a little bit of margin expansion is fantastic uh and and that rate is growing at four percent which is a much much better number than the top line one percent that they were getting before so that at least is a much better item for us if we forecast this forward you might get a better feel for earnings growth but they really got to work on that top line number you can't you can't always grow bottom line like that without some kind of movement on the top line
1,0.9999967813491821,but i think technically both these check our box for growth let's go look at enterprise value enterprise value were to begin with debt again debt is almost nothing at 3 billion dollars based on the ebitda 55 billion that's that's a drop in the bucket and what i really like is this excess cash here 81 billion dollars again for me
1,0.9999911785125732,i'm just using excess being the uh the the short term investments and the uh and the the short-term investments at asset cost those two i'm adding up converting to dollars and that's what i'm getting i did my own dollar conversion across history i didn't use their dollar in their 10k i used the korean one of the 10k and converted it just to keep my methodology similar from from 10k to 10k
1,0.9994357228279114,but i got about 81 billion dollars of excess cash not total cash total cash was 100 below 100 billion i left 20 cash in the business
1,0.9999953508377075,and i kept 80 that i can say i can dividend that out and the business has enough cash to continue to run itself and do what it needs to do this is true excess cash market cap shares outstanding times price gives me the market cap i add debt to market cap
2,0.9999979734420776,and i subtract excess cash i get the enterprise value of samsung electronics and that last fiscal year is quarter trillion dollars 247 billion up from 140 133 billion and recently it's peaked it seems like the stock has shot up a little bit with the semiconductor shortage that we're currently in i think investors are going to the stock a little bit and you've got almost a 50 percent uh move in the enterprise value just shy of 400 billion dollars debt to ebitda our risk of bankruptcy measure
1,0.9999964237213135,right
2,0.9999961853027344,i think we cover that extensively by looking at the balance sheet it's zero they have so much excess cash it wipes out everything all that enterprise value to ebitda is our value metric you can use lots of other value metrics this is one that i've used because i've seen lots of private equity and investment banking decks and pitch books and companies announce acquisitions multiples based on this metric
1,0.6668757200241089,so i like to put this metric in there as a grounding for what is value or not you're seeing a enterprise value of two 2.5 times on the low to high more recently seven times of a turning of ebitda and that is really really cheap we've seen numbers like 10x typically on growth stocks 25 30.
2,0.7166635990142822,something extreme would be 40 50 times if something's really growing this is not growing so you're not going to get the growth multiple but to have to have a payback period of three years is way too cheap in my mind so there must be something going on we're going to cover that in a second
2,0.9999960660934448,but this to me stands out as a very low market multiple but you can see the range historically here has been say four and a half to say two and a half times over the last nine years and recently it's popped up seven which is a big difference between what it's traded at historically all right let's take a look at cash flow the favorite statement my favorite statement and we'll see what this investment stacks up cash flow from operations 33 billion 2012 has grown to 55 billion dollars over this time period that's a six percent annualized growth rate which is much closer to the ebitda growth rate that we saw historically which means that again accounting expenses on the p l are following cash flow which is what we want to see this is good the reason why people say ebitda is a poor proxy for cash flow and it is a poor proxy for cash flow but it's useful because we have lots of market data reported on ebitda it's one reason i use it
1,0.9849432706832886,but we always smell check it by looking at this capex minus cash flow this is cash flow and you've got 30 billion dollars a year that samsung puts back into its enterprise to build out foundries for semiconductors for growth to invest in imaging technology and dishwashers all that stuff that takes tremendous capital and this capital must be spent to replace uh worn out equipment and it's not in the ebiddon number and interestingly enough if i take 55 billion which is close to the ebitda they had last year at 55 and i subtract 30 billion dollars right that is ebitda less capex that gives me about 20 billion dollars 20 billion dollars against an enterprise value of 250 billion is basically 10 to 11 times you follow me so it's so if i adjust ebitda for the fact that it does not have capex in it net the two i get a lower ebitda which means this market multiple is a little higher almost double 10 times that 10x is a much more realistic ebitda market multiple for a company that isn't growing the difference is that ebitda does not have capex in it
1,0.9999798536300659,and you always want to check capex as your true measure of cash flow that's why we do this sheet so when we're looking at cash flow we take cash flow from operations less capex debt is almost zero this is free cash flow this is what the business is actually based on the cash flow from equity is the the pure cash hard money that the business generated from selling its product and then after reinvesting for growth for next year and then after paying off debt this is the number 24 25 billion dollars is free cash flow it's both large and positive every year we like that
2,0.9999985694885254,and it's growing at eight percent a year that's a nice growth rate of free cash flow it's very very strong what are they used with what do they do with that free cash flow
1,0.9992799162864685,well one they're making equity investments that you saw in their equity portfolio two they're buying back their own shares over time they're reducing the share count outstanding and three they dividend some of the money out on four it just stacks up on the balance sheet so strong free cash flow buying back shares if i look at the share price per average and the yield
2,0.9999985694885254,there's a strong kind of strong single digit yield that you're getting on this stock around eight percent annually is a very good single digit yield for a company that doesn't grow top line they they grow
1,0.999997615814209,okay
0,0.9999995231628418,so now we've got a company that's got low weak low growth
1,0.9998558759689331,but it's positive no debt strong free cash flow yield high cash flow multiple
1,0.9926203489303589,and now we understand the difference between why ebitda multiple looks so low is because ebitda is missing capex when we adjust ebitda for the cost of capex the market multiple goes up to around 10 or 12 and that's a much more normalized if you will market multiple for a company that isn't growing now we understand the business now now we can forecast so let's forecast ebitda first i'm going to pick up this ebitda number
1,0.9999986886978149,and i'm going to use these averages because i know if i keep the averages relative to where they historically that assumes the same capex is going to go out
1,0.9999984502792358,and i don't have to adjust everything for the lack of the capex
2,0.9999986886978149,so what i'm going to do is i'm going to pick up the ebitda growth rate that we had before 4.3 percent i'm going to grow their ebitda 4.3 every year for the next decade
2,0.9999750852584839,and i'm going to apply the average market multiple of 3.7 that they've currently experienced to that ebitda and i get 311 billion dollars enterprise value less little debt plus some cash the historical averages i get a market cap of 400 billion divided by the shares outstanding currently
1,0.9993135929107666,and i get a 59 dollar price target out 10 years for samsung electronic same thing for free cash flow so free cash flow
1,0.9999988079071045,i'm picking up last year's free cash flow number per share
2,0.9999959468841553,and i'm growing it at a higher rate because this is the average growth rate of the cash flow from operations that they have experienced i'm pulling this number to be a true measure of cash flow for them 3.9 to 7.48 dollars per share of free cash flow i applied eight and a half uh market multiple yield to the free cash flow based on what they've had historically right here and i get a future price of 88 dollars and 34 cents now if i combine those two forecasts right we've got two different methods ebitda market multiple and a free cash flow per share method i average those two
1,0.999998927116394,and i get a seventy three dollar future price target i look into the market
1,0.9999990463256836,and i can currently buy it at seventy dollars
1,0.9999983310699463,so it's not a huge impact what you're gonna get on the irr is gonna be only the cash flow yield essentially that you're going to get on the company basically assuming that the money is dividend if it's not dividend out and it sits on the balance sheet much like we correct enterprise value for the cash on the balance sheet the market will respond and lift the share price for the amount of cash that they have on the balance sheet and it will be reflected in a higher future stock price if they don't dividend this money out i'm assuming that dividend is out for simplicity to make the math work out
2,0.9999781847000122,but that's essentially what would happen in real life now i buy in at 70 i get a stream of cash flow i'm out at 73 that's a 9 annualized irr on this investment over time basically a little over 1.8 times cash on cash return for this investment if i put it into a distribution chart seventy one dollars current price for per share nine percent irr if it drops down i think it gets attractive at the 50 range going up to 90 it's way way too out of market behind me is the math that we just went through right
1,0.999998927116394,it's historical forecast irrs chunk of the math
1,0.999998927116394,and it's kind of a a meh if if i were to give it something anything it's a matte
1,0.9999967813491821,it's not high enough to really be excited it's not low enough to really you know hate on it
1,0.9999988079071045,it's just kind of lackluster uh if we review our five key attributes top line
2,0.9999938011169434,yes it's positive it is draw checks the box ebitda is positive it's growing it checks the box strong free cash flow
1,0.9999990463256836,yes check the box low debt
1,0.9999958276748657,yes enterprise value is cheap because the return here is mediocre so i'm giving it a meh now that's the math when i did a little research online i came up with a startling fact that i was not aware of the owner original founder of the company owner the president recently passed away and his son inherits the company and his son just went to prison for six years for bribery charges in korea or he's currently in in let me he's alleged to have done this because he's still in trial
1,0.9999985694885254,but i believe the sentence was was was handed out he just hasn't yet gone to jail yet
1,0.999996542930603,but he is going to go into jail and the company as a result for the last couple years has been kind of spooling waiting for the trial to be done and waiting for this individual to come back to lead the company which for me is a huge red flag first off if he's even being accused of bribery i'm out let alone being convicted of bribery i'm out second if that's just what they convicted him on who knows what else he might be doing or capable of doing in the future if he has his hands on this company that we have put our money in so if the company itself is a meh
1,0.999948263168335,but then you add on top of that the drama with the management and the risk about having someone running a business who could potentially be engaged in fraudulent or illegal activity with the company you bought in i'm giving it an ugly i'm not putting my money anywhere near someone who has been accused of something like this so for us at the channel it's a huge pass i really really wanted to find a stock that's in the semiconductor space that is outside the united states that has its business and a different exchange i really want that diversification for my own portfolio and i really like the dominance the size the relatively cheap value of this business the free cash flow
1,0.9944098591804504,but a i think the recent price run up has expanded the market multiple
1,0.9999990463256836,it's a little too price
1,0.9999861717224121,it's a little too high anyways right now and then given the forecast of only you know four percent growth and then on top of that to read this about the the executive team it's a huge pass we're moving on to something else but definitely take a look at the 10k read through because it's a great exercise uh and we'll just move on to the next company now as always do i want to thank you for very much watching the channel all the comments subscribers i greatly appreciate it if you're looking for value stocks check out the comments down below and they're off the chain everybody's pinging in amazing stocks i'm trying to get to them it's very difficult to do them all i try to do one a week if you'd like to do this on your own you can check out in the description of this channel i have a course that i offer where i provide this template to you
