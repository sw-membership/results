1,0.9999988079071045,Let's have a talk with Lee Jooyoung on today's YouTube channel Super Ant Lee Jooyoung.
1,0.9999983310699463,Hello Mars Narae.
1,0.9999990463256836,Yeji, thank you for stopping by the market, which is your second appearance.
1,0.9999988079071045,Let's try it.
1,0.9999986886978149,What's fortunate is that after the first video came out, the comments are different.
1,0.9999988079071045,Thank you.
2,0.9999980926513672,I think it would have been better next time because the budget fit so well.
1,0.9999991655349731,Because of that, don't talk too much about Jen's mobile braces.
1,0.9999985694885254,I have to express my 10 years of experience, but you're from Ulsan, where I have to buy delicious food and eat meat.
1,0.999998927116394,Thank you so much.
1,0.9999990463256836,He wanted to study a lot about investing in Easy Stock Study, and it's not a live broadcast on Super Ant Lee Jooyoung TV.
1,0.9952869415283203,Now he responds in real time.
2,0.9947545528411865,God maintains a great phone call, so if I invest in stocks, I'm good at it, It was true, but once you actually get an investment, buying stocks at a low point in the stock market and selling them at a store is more expensive than last year if you have to go and live without energy.
1,0.9999979734420776,Oh, right.
2,0.9999904632568359,Senias who don't have 75,000 won these days are honorable compared to last year.
0,0.999998927116394,Maybe it's because they haven't experienced history, but suddenly they're losing 15 percent, so the threat is bigger.
2,0.9999973773956299,In fact, the dollar's power or the ruined trash feels very delicious, and if this happens, the reason is that the recently received Joe Biden information said he would invest in $1 trillion of dismissal, which is 1,200 trillion won in Korean money.
1,0.9999984502792358,It's a trainee who has a filial piety of 2,0002,000 for Kim's family, but it helped a lot with just one stimulus plan.
0,0.9999955892562866,So, there's a bit of damage to the dollar left in Korea, so humans have a bit of an impact, but in the long run, I don't know what will happen.
1,0.9999889135360718,But after the smell of trying very hard to maintain the value of the dollar, what is the productivity of families who play a big role in increasing productivity to the private sector?
1,0.9999984502792358,For example, Manpyeong Japan in Gyeongin Ilbo, but many investors are actually making fun of U.S. investment.
2,0.9999704360961914,The reason is because I feel like the top market cap stocks like Oepo-ri have growth potential.
1,0.9999867677688599,Then what's really unique about this is that if we want to invest in U.S. stocks around the world, if we want to invest in U.S. stocks, we have to convert money into dollars and buy stocks now.
2,0.9999977350234985,I think that's the point of view where the demand for dollars can't decrease.
2,0.9440581202507019,I think that the demand for dollars keeps increasing at K-O-K-L-O-KL and steamed ones don't come out on their own.
1,0.9999685287475586,As expected, playing an important role in improving productivity like this in his past?
2,0.9999305009841919,In the past, it was not as powerful as the United States in the past, as it was concentrated in some kind of the United States, and the US dollar status was so good.
2,0.9999847412109375,Because it was strong, but not as strong as it is now, in the past, Seokyung University paid in won dollars with missionary work in Seoul in a very cold weather, but if the dollar makes a lot of money, global investors or what we commonly call it now split the dollar a little.
2,0.9421041011810303,Since then, we've tried to stock up on Japanese yen like a Japanese yen today, but these days, looking at companies that want to strengthen the dollar, we've been looking at what kind of growth potential the U.S. has.
1,0.999998927116394,And is this a misang liquor or magic trick?
1,0.9999991655349731,And it's more like a bank than the rest.
1,0.9999986886978149,So, what China is a typical communist system is that banks control capital, eventually with certain banks, and it's basic, but if there's a little bit of pain in capitalist society, there's no basic treaty and growth potential.
2,0.9999945163726807,And if you give it to Japan and look at it now, Toyota Hyundai is a bit faster than in the past, so the human rights of trainees are participating.
1,0.9999986886978149,How about unification?
1,0.9999983310699463,Germany.
1,0.9999983310699463,Germany.
1,0.9999990463256836,I don't have any thoughts.
1,0.9999990463256836,I focused on Mercedes-Benz and Audi Volkswagen sword automobile industry.
1,0.999998927116394,Then, France is at the top of the market capitalization of farmers and French luxury brand
1,0.9999988079071045,Hermes radon removal luxury goods market?
0,0.9999505281448364,From what I can tell, some companies around the world are eventually growing drugs, Samsung Electronics, Hynix, and Korea are visually impaired.
1,0.9998427629470825,But in the case of failure, tsmc is doing it right now, and all of these things ended up in half 01 and Korea became an advanced country.
1,0.9999991655349731,I'm saying that I became an Impanie.
1,0.9999983310699463,Because of this industrial structure, as I always say, there are a lot of damages to Korea.
0,0.9999979734420776,From that perspective, they saw it positively that smoking cessation was lazy, but recently, they said that securities firms' reports foster hitting and that it comes out right away in foreign countries.
1,0.9999985694885254,But just listening to Goldman Sachs as the basic guide for the jp Morgan in guide doesn't make me feel like I have authority.
2,0.9999843835830688,It's good to deal with those things in a good way.
1,0.9999990463256836,So I looked into it and for me, I was in the stock market for 20 years.
2,0.9999957084655762,Because it went well without looking at the media.
1,0.9999991655349731,80% of the time, it's not like this.
0,0.6082284450531006,When it comes to 80% of people, not facts, when they invest in stocks, their perspectives are too bright, while my perspectives are good, bad, and bad.
0,0.9999980926513672,People who like to use the company's name law outside always say that it's very controversial if a securities firm report is used as a warehouse.
1,0.999998927116394,In fact, rather than that, we should make minimal investments.
1,0.9999991655349731,Because we have to look at all those trains.
1,0.9999990463256836,You know what happened to Barney from that perspective, right?
1,0.999995231628418,It's hard to print flyers that he finds a lot on the Jalah drive, but if you compare them overall, it's not good, but there's nothing we can do about it's hard.
1,0.9999991655349731,I'm withdrawing this account.
0,0.9999966621398926,It's a bit cloudy.
0,0.8999715447425842,If this stock falls, you have to think about whether to invest in stocks or not, but if he's in a situation where stock investment is a baby fear of low interest rates and liquid assets are continuously being supplied, then he'll be able to adjust to Paju Hanpojin's equal ideology.
1,0.9999979734420776,If you think so, as time goes by, there's room for things to go up again.
1,0.9999990463256836,Can we look at it like this?
2,0.9999984502792358,This stock can go well with individual stocks that we came to Samsung Electronics or SK Hynix yesterday.
1,0.9999990463256836,I can do it.
0,0.9999994039535522,That's what I think and I'm very confused.
2,0.9999984502792358,Samsung Electronics is good at individual stocks.
2,0.9999949932098389,Of course, it could work out well because it's a company, but when I think about semiconductors or semiconductors yesterday, I don't think it'll help me.
1,0.9999985694885254,If I think about whether DRAM prices will fall and semiconductors will be hard, I don't think so.
1,0.9999988079071045,Right?
1,0.9998828172683716,Then the semiconductor industry will get better, except for Samsung Electronics and sk events, where should we invest?
1,0.9999954700469971,She thinks that the noisy results will change all the money into dollars and change the gap investment nearby, but what I said is that we didn't make the best choice.
1,0.9999960660934448,So what I do comfortably is...
2,0.9999977350234985,What's really good about Samsung Electronics' efforts these days is that it's a fight against loneliness when investing in stocks.
1,0.9999988079071045,Because I don't invest in future stocks that I don't know about my precious assets because of my blood and sweat.
0,0.9999936819076538,It's almost impossible unless it's something unfortunate.
1,0.9999986886978149,When we first invest in stocks together, it was a series of regrets and frustration when we had little time to spare.
1,0.9999984502792358,I should've bought it at Han River, but when I talked about it for a long time, they liked it a lot.
1,0.9999990463256836,So you have to follow God's words from that perspective.
1,0.9999988079071045,It's been about 20 years.
1,0.9999969005584717,If that's the case, why can I keep my composure even in the midst of everyone's beating and talking about tweets on Earth?I told him to rap loudly yesterday because Samsung Electronics told him to do it loudly today.
1,0.9999991655349731,Then what happens if the media focuses on the main news?
1,0.99916672706604,What's wrong with Samsung Electronics?
1,0.999980092048645,What's wrong with the semiconductor?
0,0.9887738227844238,Sk Hynix is very interested in Samsung Electronics, asking if people who will be betrayed by their children once have been to me.
1,0.9999979734420776,It's not comforting to think that Korea will have a hard time if it's really hard for a child who shouldn't do that way.
1,0.9999988079071045,But if you're not a big sin when you rent a house, you don't come out these days, you don't come out of the road, and it's really hard for you psychologically.
1,0.9999984502792358,So, when I ask you to invest, if you tell me about my portfolio, you'll want to make an uni-us even if you don't want to know anything.
1,0.9999990463256836,Then I'm not falling out of the class.
1,0.9999939203262329,I'm doing something like that, but the car is falling down, so I'm going up a lot, and in the midst of my busy daily life, people who aren't investing in Seoul number b are checking everything out.
1,0.9999978542327881,But even if those big stocks stay still, they can become Naver Whale, so repentance, filtering, and comforting.
1,0.9999990463256836,But I think semiconductors are like that.
1,0.999998927116394,It seems that Korea has been sluggish since 2021 and Samsung Electronics and Samsung Electronics are mostly talking about it.
1,0.9999990463256836,There are other small and medium-sized stocks that have gone up a lot.
2,0.9999986886978149,Small and medium-sized stocks have risen more than expected, so I think that semiconductor growth is always leading to health, demand, and supply of stock prices, but Samsung Electronics is a bit confident in producing pensions.
2,0.9998397827148438,Since short selling was allowed, Amazon Samsung Electronics' foreigners seem to sell a lot as the volume of short selling has increased significantly.
1,0.9998980760574341,In fact, I don't understand short selling again.
1,0.9999279975891113,Nobody expected low-interest rates to last this long, so those who study in both houses should have studied in the U.S. for this long and inflationary 5% hedge.
2,0.999544084072113,That might make it hard for my position to go up further.
1,0.999998927116394,I think it's a position strategy.
1,0.9999990463256836,That's one of the perspectives.
1,0.9999899864196777,How is short selling a lot of Samsung Electronics' short selling attacks right now?
1,0.9999990463256836,I'm actually playing with them a lot.
1,0.9999986886978149,Short selling is actually taking place a lot, and I think it's hard for us to invest in stocks.
2,0.9999982118606567,Just because we have a good outlook, the stock price rises.
1,0.9999988079071045,When you burn it, it falls, goes up and down, but we just run around the chest hole.
1,0.9999991655349731,I hope the screenshot will be uploaded on the 14th.
1,0.9999984502792358,Anyone would like it.
2,0.999733030796051,I don't easily go up to the character, but I'm shaking it very hard with tremendous volatility, and if I have fun today, I'm sure that some stocks will go up and say it's good, then investors will be able to buy it in debt.
1,0.9999990463256836,Then my credit or investment in peace is actually the computerized accounting process.
1,0.999998927116394,So, you can find out about it electronically.
2,0.8640572428703308,Then, you'll be able to make use of those things.
1,0.999998927116394,It'll leave some room for you to make use of them.
1,0.9999948740005493,It's because for registered foreigners, it's kind of the cost of friction.
1,0.9999977350234985,In the case of fees, the more transactions we have, the more we can get, so the reason why we should not be careless when investing in stocks is because we buy Clova poop cheaply and sell expensive things.
1,0.9999958276748657,You might think, "Why is it the prettiest way to buy expensive and make lines cheaply?
0,0.9999953508377075,Even if it falls at once, I know from the weakest point of view that why stocks fall so good at any time."
1,0.999977707862854,So life is a staple food and whaling, but to my mother-in-law, I think I can make a lot of money if I buy it cheaply and sell it at a high price, but if I actually participate, I'm sorry for the adversity and hardship.
1,0.9999988079071045,If you look back on the past, there was a Samsung Electronics crisis theory in the past, and we were always there because you always worked hard.
1,0.9999990463256836,Is it similar to then and now when it comes to zombie relationships?
1,0.9999970197677612,In my opinion, Samsung Electronics had a lot more competitors in the past.
2,0.9999485015869141,To be honest, the fact that it's gotten worse means that my current position is better.
1,0.9999982118606567,In the past, I didn't like Samsung Electronics that much before about five years ago, saying, "If it's easy now, I don't study according to the number I requested to join Samsung Electronics."
1,0.9999990463256836,Because you know the Wooad Panel market in China.
1,0.9999983310699463,In the case of the lcd market, in the case of the TV market for families with disabilities at the airport, it's cheap because China follows too quickly, and in the case of a memory semiconductor like DRAM, it can be cheap in China.
1,0.9999713897705078,It's not something we can do, but if we bring in a lot of quality, we can mass-produce surplus and naturally mass-produce eyebrows with quality, so how should Samsung Electronics treat them?
0,0.999998927116394,So I was a little worried about the disease, but you're pushing for it at every price.
1,0.9999986886978149,But looking at it now, after the two changes, people like smartphones so much that they're so precious.
1,0.9999984502792358,When I go to lectures, if there are a lot of people who gave offline lectures and made headlines, raise your hand if you wake up and avoid your smartphone for an hour.
1,0.9999991655349731,Then, there's no one.
1,0.9999982118606567,These days, when I open my eyes to my phone, I use my phone a lot, so the performance of this phone is very important because people say it's buffering.
1,0.8499276041984558,If I save a memory and it disappears, Some say that people don't buy low-quality semiconductors in Korea because smartphones and home-style products are getting too long.
1,0.9998759031295776,Second, Taiwan's TSmc was trying to expand factories in China to keep China in check.
2,0.9999372959136963,But since we are Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, we have a lot of long votes in the U.S., but even if Samsung Electronics changed it, it went up well.
1,0.9975007176399231,From that point of view, I think autonomous driving is getting faster and faster.
0,0.9999992847442627,I think it hurt a lot.
1,0.9999978542327881,I think it's moving fast enough to feel like the car will go after 10 years.
1,0.9999984502792358,But now, if we take out semiconductor lectures that contain semiconductors from rain, it's better to re-develop smartphones.
1,0.9999990463256836,Eunjung from 0 years ago, I'm proud because she said it was a small news in the past, but there isn't.
1,0.9999985694885254,There's a big news that we'really.
0,0.9999828338623047,If there's news like this, I'm really nervous about it at first, but it's not easy for the world to say that because of a big incident that hasn't been reported.
1,0.999997615814209,Wang Geon, who established child capitalism, eventually controls Ryu, but the Indian currency we value afterwards cannot be broken down so easily because we live hard in the number of hapees.
1,0.9999978542327881,It's because you get used to getting used to the ashes and then recovering and recovering.
0,0.9999990463256836,That's why in the past, I had to sell my stocks before I ran out of the quietness of the prince, Juicy wiggle, or why I invested in stocks once, and now I have to be very upset.
2,0.9999983310699463,Chungha, who's been working well with my wife and colleague, at Cheonan Curtain Shop, if we study hard, we'll have to eat it well to show it to our Neung woman.
2,0.9999711513519287,Even if I'm not a woman, I'm very sincere and hardworking among women until 12 p.m. at the Office of Education.
2,0.9999980926513672,No matter how hard I eat and try, tsmc is going well now, but the pound is that we need so many semiconductors that we're going to grow really rapidly.
1,0.9869349002838135,He told me to do Samsung Electronics, but since it's SKY, I think he's a positive type of entertainment because he's a person who leads a company.
1,0.999998927116394,Being a former soldier is basically an investment in the future.
2,0.9999985694885254,People here work hard and use better sales.
1,0.9999988079071045,Under the premise of this, is it investing in stocks you buy?
1,0.999994158744812,Oh, investing in stocks requires investing in order to look positively at the future, but the future comes out a lot.
0,0.9999995231628418,The future hurts and is unstable.
1,0.9999988079071045,We have to invest in stocks.
1,0.9999990463256836,I think it's that kind of perspective.
2,0.9999982118606567,So from a positive point of view, whether we should invest or not per month, Hamsoa Bio9 blockers had growth potential, but sales and operating profit were less than those of the disabled, and jam semiconductors had growth potential, but last year, Tem Samsung Electronics left more than 3% dividends.
0,0.9999988079071045,Considering that preferred stocks are interfering with chapel worship due to obstruction of 4.2 percent or more disability, I'd like to say that any company that can reduce more than 2% per month of awareness and aftereffects can withstand Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor POSCO.
2,0.9996591806411743,As the stock that gives taxi dividends decreases, the construction dividend increases, so if you take interest dividends and give dividends to stocks with good managers, I don't know if I can clean up last year, but I think Samsung Electronics dividends about 6 trillion won last year, including special dividends.
2,0.9999986886978149,So, after cleaning officials took about 1 trillion won due to a surge in aggregate demand, foreigners who visit for a week later received dividends of about 4 degrees.
1,0.9999986886978149,So, my stock is...
1,0.9999955892562866,If the semiconductor industry is not good today, There may be news that we can't read, but isn't there a case where foreigners sell stocks aggressively using various insurance applications?
1,0.9999974966049194,Because if you sell stocks and sell them again, you won't know if you're in a position to sell futures.
1,0.999998927116394,I can make money.
1,0.9999818801879883,I'm glad to see you.
1,0.9999986886978149,Intentionally, I'm interested in it these days.
1,0.9991762042045593,If the short selling is suddenly bad, there is too much news about semiconductors.
1,0.999998927116394,And the future is that individuals who have difficulty getting rid of them are stocks.
1,0.999998927116394,Nobody knows.
0,0.9952753782272339,For those who used to have stocks but didn't pretend to know themselves, if they put my precious assets in before they were very anxious, they could drop stocks humanely from stimulation, deliberately go up in coloring, and if two volatility stays in the stock market for a long time, they'll be a little calm.
1,0.9999985694885254,That's what I'm saying.
1,0.9999988079071045,I want to have that, too.
1,0.9999988079071045,I didn't invest in Samsung Electronics back then, so from 2018, his year of 2018.
0,0.9999126195907593,When that time comes, it keeps falling.
